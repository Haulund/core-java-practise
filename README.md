## Excersizes

Collections:


    1. sort an array of strings, numbers and objects
        - Strings: alphabetical
        - Numbers: Ascending
        - Objects: by a String field value
    
    2. 


Strings:

    1. Count letters of a word
    2. first occorrence of a letter used 2 times in a word
    3. Array of ints -> how many int are there more than 3 times.
    4. List of ints -> who has a adjacent value higher than it self.
    5. sum of squared odd numbers in list
    6. filter even numbers
    7. print x everytime a number is divideble with 6 and 5


Excersizes with exceptions

Excersizes with multiple types of topics, like: 


    1. sort an array of strings based on 4th letter, if there a less than for letters remove word from array
Use functional interface:

Date:

    1. Get the current time in New York.
    2. Get the name of the first and last day of a month.
    3. Calculate your age based in date of birth.
    4. Print yyyy-MM-dd, HH:mm:ss, yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss, E MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss.SSSZ and HH:mm:ss,Z, format pattern for date and time.
    5. Display the dates in the following formats:
        LocalDate = 15::Feb::2023                                                                                                 
        LocalDateTime = 15::Feb::2023 11::46::01
    
HashMap:

    1. Copy all of the mappings from one HashMap to another.
    2. Get the square of all values in a HashMap<Integer, Integer> and get the sum.
    
Streams API:
    
    1: Create a string that consists of the first letter of each word in a list of Strings. 
        HINT: Use a StringBuilder to construct the result.
    2: Remove the words that have odd length from a list.
    3: Replace every word in a list with its upper case equivalent.
    4: Convert every key-value pair of a map into a string and append them all into a single string, in iteration order. 
        HINT: Again, use a StringBuilder to construct the result String.
    5: Create a new Thread that prints the numbers from a list.
