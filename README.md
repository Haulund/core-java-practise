    5. sum of squared odd numbers in list
    6. filter even numbers
    7. print x everytime a number is divideble with 6 and 5


Excersizes with exceptions

Excersizes with multiple types of topics, like: 


    1. sort an array of strings based on 4th letter, if there a less than for letters remove word from array
Use functional interface:

Date:

    2. Get the name of the first and last day of a month.
    3. Calculate your age based in date of birth.
    4. Print yyyy-MM-dd, HH:mm:ss, yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss, E MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss.SSSZ and HH:mm:ss,Z, format pattern for date and time.
    5. Display the dates in the following formats:
        LocalDate = 15::Feb::2023                                                                                                 
        LocalDateTime = 15::Feb::2023 11::46::01
    
HashMap:

    1. Copy all of the mappings from one HashMap to another.
    2. Get the square of all values in a HashMap<Integer, Integer> and get the sum.
